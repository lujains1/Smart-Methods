# Text To Speech 
## Description
I created a web page using HTML to create the structure, CSS for the styling and JavaScript to convert text to speech using the Speech Synthesis API.

## The Files
The project contains at HTML, CSS and JavaScript files :

### HTML 
The [index.html](https://github.com/lujains1/Smart-Methods/blob/main/Web%20Programming%20and%20NLP%20/Text_To_Speech/index.html) file provides the structure and content for text to speech webpage. It contains a text area to type text and a button to convert the entered text to speech.

### CSS 
The [style.css](https://github.com/lujains1/Smart-Methods/blob/main/Web%20Programming%20and%20NLP%20/Text_To_Speech/style.css) file to style the web page .

### JavaScript
The [script.js](https://github.com/lujains1/Smart-Methods/blob/main/Web%20Programming%20and%20NLP%20/Text_To_Speech/script.js) file :
- Initialization : selects a textarea and a button from the webpage and set up 'isSpeaking' variable to true to track the speaking state.
- Text to Speech function : initiates text-to-speech conversion, manages speech pause/resume for long text, and updates the button's label based on the speech state.
- Event Listener : connect the text to speech function to the button's click event.
