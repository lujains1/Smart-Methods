# What is Lidar
The Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is a sensor used for distance measurement. 
Basically, itâ€™s a version of radar but instead of radio waves, it uses light. It assists robots 
in navigating their surroundings by providing object perception, object identification, 
and collision avoidance.
