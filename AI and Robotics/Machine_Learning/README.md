# Titanic Machine Learning
## Description
use machine learning to create a model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. To train the model, I used Logistic Regression and evaluated its performance using an accuracy score.

## Dataset
The dataset used is available on Kaggle:
[Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## The Task Structure
### Importing The Dependencies
This section for importing the libraries which are : 
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn

### Reading The Data
This section for load the dataset and printing the shape of the data .

### Data Preprocessing
Here the info command is used to find out more about the data, such as the number of rows and columns, data types, and the number of missing values.

### Model Building
This section contains : 
1. Separating Features & Target
2. Splitting the data into training data & Testing data
3. Model training using Logistic Regression

### Model Evaluation
The last section evaluates the model using the accuracy score, a common evaluation metric, measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions.The model achieved an accuracy score of 78%. <br><br>
